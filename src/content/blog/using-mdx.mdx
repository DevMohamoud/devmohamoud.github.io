Here are the core concepts of modern-day general programming language.	
#### ""`You can never understand everything. But, you should push yourself to understand the system -Ryan Dahl(developer of Node.js)`


# (1)  Syntax & Semantic 
### Syntax: `the grammar of the language.`
### Semantics: `the meaning of the syntax (grammar).`
A programmer must ensure program is syntactically and semantically correct before compiling 
his code.
#### `javaScript example: program both syntactically and semantically correct.`
```js
> function square(i,j) {
	return i*j;
}
> square(2,5) // 10
```

# (2) Programming Paradigm
Each paradigm consist a way to organize program. For example, C programming language is imperative paradigm.
The programs are sequence of steps defined into small blocks that are both syntactically and semantically correct.
These code blocks are organized function definitions and struct definitions. 
A function definition is a block of code that performs a specific task and struct definition is collection 
of primitive data types under a single structure. 
### C 
```c
#include <stddef.h>
#include <stdio.h>

// function definitions
int square(int n) {
	int result = n * n;
	return result;
}

int main() {
	// struct definitions
	struct lang { char *name; char *paradigm; int year; };
	struct lang l = {.name="javaScript", .paradigm="multi-paradigm", .year=1995};
	printf("language: %s %s %d\n", l.name, l.paradigm, l.year);
	return 0;
}
```


# (3) Source code 
All programs are combinition of assignment statement, selection statement and loops.
Here's a example that showcase all statements. We're going to implement binary search algorithm
using javaScript.
```js
> function binarySearch(array, target) {
	let left = array[0];
	let right = array.length-1;

	while(left <= right) {
		let mid = Math.floor((left+right)/2);

		if (array[mid] === target) {
			return mid;
		}
		if (array[mid] < target) {
			left = mid-1;
		}
		if (array[mid] > target) {
			right = mid+1;
		}
	}
	console.log('Target not found!');
}
```
This is an assignment statement `left = arr[0].` `left` is assigned to array index-zero value. 
The selection statements are `if, else if & else`. As for the loops, we are using while loop 
in the example above `while()`.
